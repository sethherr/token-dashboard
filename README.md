# Token Dashboard (mucky fork)

> **Fork notice.** This is a personal fork of [nateherkai/token-dashboard](https://github.com/nateherkai/token-dashboard) with several community pull requests integrated because upstream is currently inactive. See [FORK_NOTES.md](FORK_NOTES.md) for the full list of integrated changes and what differs from upstream.

A local dashboard that reads the JSONL transcripts Claude Code writes to `~/.claude/projects/` and turns them into per-prompt cost analytics, tool/file heatmaps, subagent attribution, cache analytics, project comparisons, and a rule-based tips engine.

**Everything runs locally.** No data leaves your machine — no telemetry, no API calls for your data, no login.

## What this is useful for

- Seeing which of your prompts are expensive (surprise: they usually involve large tool results).
- Comparing token usage across projects you've worked on.
- Spotting wasteful patterns — the same file read twenty times in a session, a tool call returning 80k tokens.
- Understanding what a "cache hit" actually saves you.
- If you're on Pro or Max, confirming you're getting your money's worth in API-equivalent dollars.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or newer** — already installed on macOS and most Linux. On Windows: `winget install Python.Python.3.12` or download from python.org.
- **Claude Code** — installed and with at least one session run. The dashboard reads those sessions. If you just installed Claude Code and haven't used it yet, run at least one prompt first.
- **A web browser.** Any modern one.

No `pip install`. No Node.js. No build step.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muckybuzzwoo/token-dashboard.git
cd token-dashboard
python3 cli.py dashboard
```

> On Windows, if `python3` isn't on your PATH, substitute `py -3` for `python3` in every command below.

The command:
1. Scans `~/.claude/projects/` (first run is fast in this fork — around 5–10 seconds for ~600 files / 60k+ messages thanks to the batched-insert scanner from PR #18).
2. Starts a local server at http://127.0.0.1:8080.
3. Opens your default browser to that URL.

Leave it running; it re-scans every 30 seconds and pushes updates live. Stop with `Ctrl+C`.

## Where the data comes from

Claude Code writes one JSONL file per session here:

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/<session-id>.jsonl` |
| Windows | `C:\Users\<you>\.claude\projects\<project-slug>\<session-id>.jsonl` |

The dashboard never modifies those files — it only reads them and keeps a local SQLite cache at `~/.claude/token-dashboard.db`.

To point at a different location:

```bash
python3 cli.py dashboard --projects-dir /path/to/projects --db /path/to/cache.db
```

You can also change the `.claude` folder from the Settings tab. Changing the folder controls future scans; it does not automatically partition old cached data in the current SQLite DB. When switching accounts or profiles, either enable **Clear cached transcript data** in Settings before saving, or launch with a separate `--db` path if you want to keep each folder's dashboard history isolated.

### Environment variables

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8080` | Port the local web server listens on |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. Keep the default. Setting `0.0.0.0` exposes your entire prompt history to anyone on your local network — don't do this on any network you don't fully control (no coffee-shop Wi-Fi, no coworking spaces). |
| `CLAUDE_PROJECTS_DIR` | `~/.claude/projects` | Where to scan for session JSONL files |
| `TOKEN_DASHBOARD_DB` | `~/.claude/token-dashboard.db` | SQLite cache location |

Pricing lives in [`pricing.json`](pricing.json). Edit it directly if model prices change or to add a new plan.

## CLI reference

```bash
python3 cli.py scan          # populate / refresh the local DB, then exit
python3 cli.py today         # today's totals (terminal)
python3 cli.py stats         # all-time totals (terminal)
python3 cli.py tips          # active suggestions (terminal)
python3 cli.py dashboard     # scan + serve the UI at http://localhost:8080

# dashboard flags
python3 cli.py dashboard --no-open   # don't auto-open the browser
python3 cli.py dashboard --no-scan   # skip the initial scan (use cached DB only)
```

Change the port: `PORT=9000 python3 cli.py dashboard`.

## The tabs

The dashboard is a single page with a hash-router tab bar across the top; **Skills & Commands, Plugins, MCP and Hooks live under a "Register ▾" dropdown**, the rest are top-level tabs. Each tab is backed by its own JSON API under `/api/`:

- **Overview** — all-time input/output/cache tokens, sessions, turns, estimated cost on your chosen plan, daily work and cache-read charts, tokens-by-project, token share by model, top tools by call count, and recent sessions. This is the landing tab.
- **Prompts** — your most expensive user prompts ranked by tokens. Click any row to see the assistant response, tool calls made, and the size of each tool result. Has a "Copy MD" / "Download CSV" export for the current sort/filter.
- **Sessions** — turn-by-turn view of any single session, with per-turn tokens and tool calls.
- **Projects** — per-project comparison: tokens, session counts, and which files were touched most.
- **Workspaces** — bipartite ECharts Sankey of agent cwd (left) → file target (right), counting Read/Edit/Write/NotebookEdit only. Same-name pairs are within-workspace work; cross-pairs are CLAUDE.md consolidation candidates. Includes a ranked cross-workspace leaks table with the top files driving each pair.
- **Subagents & Orchestration** — per-model spend split into **main thread** vs **Task subagent** vs **auto-compaction** (`agent_id LIKE 'acompact-*'`), a per-entrypoint chart (`cli` / `claude-vscode` / SDK runs), an external-orchestration table for `sdk-py`/`sdk-ts`/`sdk-cli` sessions, and a dispatcher → child agent dispatch tree reconstructed via session_id + timing-join.
- **Skills & Commands** — split between **You ran** (distinct sessions where you typed a `/slash-command`, tracked via Claude Code's native `attributionSkill` field) and **Claude invoked** (real `Skill` tool calls Claude emitted itself, typically from `Task`/`Agent`-dispatched subagents). Also shows per-skill output-token budget (parsed from `SKILL.md`) vs. measured p50/p95, total cost, and total including subagent attribution. See [limitations](docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md#skills-tokens-per-call-is-blank-when-a-skill-runs-only-through-taskagent).
- **Plugins** *(under Register)* — every plugin in `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`: enabled/disabled state, source marketplace, version, component counts (skills / agents / commands) and an approximate always-on token cost. Read-only; "Open in editor" jumps to the plugin's install path.
- **MCP** *(under Register)* — configured MCP servers: local ones from `~/.claude.json` plus servers shipped by installed, enabled plugins (their `.mcp.json`). Account-level claude.ai connectors (Gmail, Calendar, Slack) aren't listed — they have no local config to read. See [limitations](docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).
- **Hooks / Commands / Agents** *(under Register)* — configured hooks from `settings.json` (with a broken-script check), your user commands from `~/.claude/commands/`, and commands/agents shipped by installed plugins.
- **RTK** — optional [rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) savings view if the CLI is installed at `~/.local/bin/rtk`. Gracefully degrades on Windows or when RTK is absent (shows install instructions).
- **Tips** — rule-based suggestions for reducing token usage. 19 detectors covering cache-hit rate, repeated file reads, repeated Bash commands, Opus turns that would fit on Sonnet, oversized tool results, subagent outliers, skill-listing budget pressure (scope-aware: reports effective per-session footprint and splits global vs project-scoped skills, named after the most-active recent project), oversized `CLAUDE.md`, cross-workspace leaks, dead skills (90d unused, excluding project-scoped skills in projects you haven't visited), subagent sprawl (sidechain dominates main thread), Bash bloat (commands without output limiters), context-window pressure, repeated identical Bash errors, heavy web-fetch sessions, Opus-only workspaces, MCP-server sprawl, stacked `CLAUDE.md` files, and overlong skill descriptions. Detectors that flag several items (e.g. repeated files, cross-workspace leaks, context-heavy sessions) group their instances into **one collapsible section** — the shared advice shown once, the concrete instances listed collapsed below with a per-instance dismiss. Each tip is dismissable for 14 days; drill-down links jump to the responsible session, project, or skill.
- **Settings** — pick your plan (API / Pro / Max / Max-20x / Team). This does **not** change the dollar figures shown elsewhere — they're always the API pay-per-token value of your usage — it just shows your flat monthly fee next to them for comparison, so you can see whether your usage is worth more than you pay. Also lets you switch the `.claude` folder at runtime.

Most data-heavy tabs carry a built-in, collapsible **explanation panel** (look for the "— click to expand" hint): the Overview's "What do these numbers mean?" glossary, plus column/chart guides on Prompts, Skills & Commands, Subagents and Workspaces. Each defines its metrics in plain English — what they measure, an example, and what you can read out of them — and is collapsed by default to keep the view uncluttered.

## Troubleshooting

**"No data" or empty charts.** Run `python3 cli.py scan` once to populate the DB, then reload.

**Port 8080 already in use.** `PORT=9000 python3 cli.py dashboard`.

**Numbers look wrong / stuck.** The DB lives at `~/.claude/token-dashboard.db`. Delete it and re-run `python3 cli.py scan` to rebuild from scratch. If you changed the `.claude` folder in Settings, use **Clear cached transcript data** when saving the new folder to avoid combining data from multiple transcript roots.

**Running the dashboard twice at the same time.** Don't — both processes will fight over the SQLite DB. Stop all instances before starting a new one.

## Accuracy note

Claude Code writes each assistant response 2–3 times to disk while it streams (the same API message gets snapshotted as output grows). The dashboard dedupes these by `message.id` so the final tally matches what the API actually billed. If you compare against another tool that sums every JSONL row, expect this dashboard's numbers to be lower — and closer to reality.

## Privacy

Nothing leaves your machine. No telemetry. No remote calls for your data. The browser fetches its JSON from `127.0.0.1`, and all JS/CSS/fonts are served from that same local server — ECharts is vendored into `web/`, and the UI falls back to system fonts rather than pulling from a font CDN. If you want to verify: `grep -r "https://" token_dashboard/ web/` — you'll find nothing.

## Tech stack

Python 3 (stdlib only) for the CLI, scanner, and HTTP server. SQLite for the local cache. Vanilla JS + ECharts for the UI, no build step. Dark theme, hash-based router, server-sent events for live refresh.

Data flow: `cli.py` → `token_dashboard/scanner.py` → SQLite DB; `token_dashboard/server.py` exposes `/api/*` JSON routes and serves `web/`.
