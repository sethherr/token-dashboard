"""Skill catalog: locate SKILL.md files and map slugs to file sizes.

A skill on disk lives at one of:
  ~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md                     -> slug "<name>"
  ~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/<name>/SKILL.md            -> slug "<name>"
  ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/*/plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
      -> registers TWO slugs: "<plugin>:<name>" and "<name>"
      (Claude Code accepts either form in the Skill tool.)

Sizes are in chars; token estimate is chars // 4 (the same approximation
`scanner._extract_results` uses for tool-result tokens).

Active-set filtering
--------------------
`~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` is Claude Code's source of truth
for which plugins are actually loaded. Plenty of SKILL.md files live on disk
under `~/.claude/plugins/` as marketplace clones (downloaded metadata) without
ever being installed -- they don't consume context and shouldn't show up in
budget tips. We honour the manifest: only plugin paths listed there contribute
to the catalog.

Each catalog entry carries its scope so callers can reason about per-context
activity:
  scope="user-global"     -> active in every session (user-skills, scheduled-
                             tasks, scope=user manifest entries)
  scope="project-global"  -> active only when cwd is under project_path
                             (manifest scope=project entries)
  scope="project-local"   -> active only when cwd is under project_path
                             (cwd/.claude/skills/ discovered from DB cwds)
  scope="unknown"         -> legacy fallback when manifest is missing/unreadable;
                             treated as user-global by active-set helpers
